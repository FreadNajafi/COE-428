This C code defines a simple state machine with 8 states (A to H) and commands to traverse, print, and modify the state machine. Users can input commands to change state transitions, delete states, and perform garbage collection. The program provides functions to print the current state and states reachable from the current state. It also allows users to mark states as deleted or unreachable.
