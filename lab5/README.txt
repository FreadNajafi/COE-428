In order to modify Requirement 1 to allow stand-alone tags, we would need to update the stack implementation in the program to keep track of both start tags and stand-alone tags.

Currently, the stack implementation only handles start tags and end tags. To handle stand-alone tags, we would need to modify the stack implementation to be able to store both start tags and stand-alone tags. This could be achieved by adding a flag or some other type of indicator to each item that is pushed onto the stack, to indicate whether it is a start tag, end tag, or stand-alone tag.

In addition, we would need to modify the logic in the main function to correctly handle stand-alone tags. Specifically, when encountering a stand-alone tag, we would need to push it onto the stack and then immediately pop it off again, since it does not require a corresponding end tag.

Overall, the modifications required to handle stand-alone tags would not be too complex, but they would require some careful changes to the stack implementation and the program logic to ensure that everything works correctly.
